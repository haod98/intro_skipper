# Goal of this extension
A Google Chrome extension (for now) to fast forward videos. Initial goal of this project was to set custom seconds to fast forward, so you can skip intros of a show. 

# How to install
Right now Firefox is not supported, because they don't support Manifest V3.

Since it is not in Google Extension Store you have to download the latest release and add it manually.
1. Open Google Chrome and insert ``chrome://extensions`` in the URL
3. Enable ``Developer mode`` (In the right corner)
4. Unzip `release.zip`
5. Click ``Load unpacked`` and select the folder where the files is saved
6. When everything is working you should see the Time Skipper extension loaded
Bonus: For easier use, click on the puzzle-icon and pin Time Skipper extension 

# How to use
Right now it only works with YouTube videos. 
Open the extension pop up and customize your desired fast forward seconds (Default: 60 seconds). 
By pressing the button "Fast forward", the video should fast forward the seconds you specified. 

## Shortcuts
On Windows and Linux:

Fast Forward: ``Alt`` + ``Shift`` + ``F`` will skip the video, without to open the pop up and/or pressing the "Fast forward"-button

On Mac:

Fast Forward: ``Command`` + ``Shift`` + ``S``
